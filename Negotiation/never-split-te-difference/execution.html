            <h2>How to Spot the Liars and Ensure Follow-Through from Everyone Else:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask Calibrated "How" questions, and ask them again and again. Asking "How" keeps your counterparts engaged but off balance. Answering the questions will give them the illusion of control. It will also lead them to contemplate your problems when making their demands.</li>
                <li>Use "How" questions to shape the negotiating enviroment. You do this by using "How can I do that?" as a gentle version of "No". This will subtly push your counterpart to search for other solutions - your solutions. And very often it will get them to bid against themselves.</li>
                <li>Don't just pay attention to the people you're negotiatin with directly; always identify the motivations of the players "behind the table". You can do so by asking how a deal will affect everybody else and how on board they are.</li>
                <li>Follow the 7-38-55 Percent Rule by paying close attention to tone of voice and body language. Incongruence between the words and nonverbal signs will show when your counterpart is lying or uncomfortable with a deal.</li>
                <li>Is the "Yes" real or counterfeit? Test it with the Rule of Three: use calibrated questions, summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to reaffirm their aggreement at least three times. It's really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction.</li>
                <li>A person's use of pronouns offers deep insights into his or her relative authority. If you're hearing a lot of "I","me", and "my", the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking up a lot of "we", "they", and "them", it's more likely you're dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options open.</li>
                <li>Use your own name to make yourself a real person to the other side and even get your own personal discount. Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove roadblocks.</li>
