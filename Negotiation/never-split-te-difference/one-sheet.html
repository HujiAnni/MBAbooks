            <h2>SECTION I: THE GOAL</h2>
            <p>Think through best/worst-case scenarios but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set an optimistic but reasonable goal and define it clearly.</li>
                <li>Write it down.</li>
                <li>Discuss your goal with a colleague (this makes it harder to wimp out).</li>
                <li>Carry the written goal into the negotiation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SECTION II: SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>Summarize and write out in just a couple of sentences the known facts that have led up to the negotiation.</p>
            <p>You have to clearly describe the lay of the land before you can think about acting in its confines. Why are you there? What do you want? What do they want? Why?</p>
            <p>You must be able to summarize a situation in a way that your counterpart will respond with a "That's right." If they don't, you haven't done it right.</p>

              <h2>SECTION IV: CALIBRATED QUESTIONS</h2>
              <p>Prepare three to five calibrated questions to reveal value to you and your counterpart and identify and overcome potential deal killers.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>What are we trying to accomplish?</li>
                  <li>How is that worthwhile?</li>
                  <li>What's the core issue here?</li>
                  <li>How does that affect things?</li>
                  <li>What's the biggest challenge you face?</li>
                  <li>How does this fit into what the objectiv is?</li>

              <p><em>Questions to indentify behind-the-table deal killers</em></p>
              <ul>
                <li>How does this affect the rest of your team?</li>
                <li>How on board are the people not on this call?</li>
                <li>What do your colleauges see as their main challenges in this area?</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Questions to identify and defuse deal-killing issues</em></p>
              <p>Often they have more to do with self-esteem, status, autonomy, and other nonfinancial needs.</p>
              <p>Think about their percieved losses. Never forget that a loss stings at least twice as much as an equivalent gain.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>What are we up against here?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the biggest challenge you face?</li>
                    <li>How does making a deal with us affect things?</li>
                    <li>What happens if you do nothing?</li>
                    <li>What does doing nothing cost you?</li>
                    <li>How does making this deal resonate with what your company prides itself on?</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Be ready to execute follow-up labels to their ansers to your calibrated questions.</em></p>
              <ul>
                <li>It seems like _____ is important.</li>
                <li>It seems you feel like my company is in a unique position to ______.</li>
                <li>It seems like you are worried about _______.</li>
