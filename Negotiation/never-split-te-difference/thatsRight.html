            <h2>Here are some key lessons from this chapter summarized by ChatGPT:</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>The phrase "That's right" can be a powerful negotiation tool: By using the phrase "That's right" and acknowledging the other party's perspective, you can create a sense of understanding and build rapport, which can help move the negotiation forward.</li>
            <li>Use "That's right" to gather information: Asking open-ended questions and using "That's right" to acknowledge the other party's responses can help you gather more information and better understand their perspective.</li>
            <li>Be genuine when using "That's right": It's important to be sincere when using "That's right" and not use it in a manipulative or insincere way.</li>
            <li>Use "That's right" in combination with other negotiation techniques: "That's right" can be most effective when used in combination with other negotiation techniques, such as mirroring and emotion labeling.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How to Gain the Permission to Persuade:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating unconditional positive regard opens the door to changing thoughts and behaviors. Humans have an innate urge towards socially constructive behavior. The more a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behavior will take hold.</li>
                <li>"That's right" is better than "yes". Strive for it. Reaching "that's right" in a negotiation creates breakthroughs.</li>
                <li>Use a summary to trigger a "that's right." The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing. Identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm "the world according to ..."</li>
