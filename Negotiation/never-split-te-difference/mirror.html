          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">In the second chapter of Never Split the Difference, Chris Voss discusses the importance of using "mirroring" as a negotiation technique. Mirroring involves repeating back the other person's words or phrases in a way that demonstrates understanding and empathy. </p>

            <h2>Here are some key lessons from this chapter summarized by ChatGPT:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mirroring helps build rapport: By repeating back the other person's words, you can create a sense of understanding and connection, which can help build trust and establish a positive negotiating dynamic.</li>
                <li>Mirroring can diffuse tension: By acknowledging and reflecting the other person's emotions, you can help diffuse tension and create a more productive negotiating environment.</li>
                <li>Use mirroring to gather information: Asking open-ended questions and mirroring the other person's responses can help you gather more information and better understand their perspective.</li>
                <li>Be careful not to overuse mirroring: While mirroring can be a useful technique, it's important not to overuse it or it can come across as insincere or manipulative.</li>
                <li>Practice mirroring in different contexts: Mirroring can be a valuable tool in a variety of negotiation situations, so it's important to practice using it in different contexts to become comfortable and proficient with the technique.</li>

            <h2>How to Quickly Establish Rapoort:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A good negotiatior prepares, goining in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.</li>
                <li>Don't commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously.</li>
                <li>People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it's a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.</li>
                <li>To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.</li>
                <li>Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we're too much in a hurry,people can feel as if they're not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport and trust you've built.</li>
                <li>Put a smil on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.</li>
                There are three voice tones available to negotiators:
                <ol>
                    <li>The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectivly to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness.</li>
                    <li>The positive/playful voice: Should e your default voice. It's the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The hey here is to relax and smile while you're talking.</li>
                    <li>The direct or ssertive voice: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.</li>
