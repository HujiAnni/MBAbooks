            <h2>How to Shape What Is Fair:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. Don't let yourself be fooled by the surface. Once you know that the Haitian kidnappers just want party money, you will be miles better prepared.</li>
                <li>Splitting the difference is wearing one black and on brown shoe, so don't compromise. Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides.</li>
                <li>Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process and do impulsive things that are against their best interests.</li>
                <li>The F-word - "Fair" - is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops the F-bomb, don't get suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to explain how you're mistreating them.</li>
                <li>You can bend your counterpart's reality by anchoring his starting point. Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be. When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your "real" offer seam reasonable, or use a range to seem less aggressive. The real value of anything depands on what vantage point you're looking at it from.</li>
                <li>People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. Make sure your couterpart sees that there is something to lose by inaction.</li>
