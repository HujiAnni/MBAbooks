            <h2>How to Create Breakthroughs by Revealing the Unknown Unknowns:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Let what you know - your <em>known knowns</em> - guide you but not blind you. Every case is new, so remain flexible and adaptable. Remember the Griffin bank crisis: no hostage-taker had killed a hostage on deadline, until he did.</li>
                <li>Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage: positive (the ablity to give someone what they want); negative (the ability to hurt someone"; and normative (using your counterpart's norms to bring them around).</li>
                <li>Work to understand the other side's "religion". Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. That's where Black Swans live.</li>
                <li>Review everything you hear from your counterpart. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with team members. Use backup listeners whose job is to listen between the lines. They wil hear things you miss.</li>
                <li>Exploit the similarity principle. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground.</li>
                <li>When someone seems irrational or crazy, they most likely aren't. Faced with this situation, search for contraints, hidden desires, and bad information.</li>
                <li>Get face time with your counterpart. Ten minutes of face time often reveals more than days of research. Pay special attention to your counterpart's verbal and nonverbal communicaiton at unguarded moments - at the beginning and the end of the session or when someone says something out of line.</li>
