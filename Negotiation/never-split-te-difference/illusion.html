            <h2>Key lessons from this chapter summarized by ChatGPT:</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Creating the illusion of control can be a powerful negotiation tool: By giving the other party the sense that they have control over the negotiation process, you can create a more collaborative and productive dynamic.</li>
            <li>Use "If-Then" statements to create the illusion of control: "If-Then" statements, such as "If you agree to X, then I will consider Y", can help give the other party a sense of control and increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.</li>
            <li>Be sincere when using the illusion of control: It's important to be genuine and sincere when using the illusion of control, as insincere or manipulative tactics can damage trust and undermine the negotiation process.</li>
            <li>Use the illusion of control in combination with other negotiation techniques: The illusion of control can be most effective when used in combination with other negotiation techniques, such as mirroring and emotion labeling.</li>

            <h2>How to Calibrate Questions to Transform Conflict into Colleboration:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation.</li>
                <li>Avoid questions that can be answered with "Yes" or tiny pieces of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity; you will be expected to give something back.</li>
                <li>Ask calibrated questions that start with the words "How" or "What." By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and wil inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information.</li>
                <li>Don't ask questions that start with "Why" unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. "Why" is always an accusation, in any language.</li>
                <li>Calibrate your questions to pont your counterpart toward solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on divising a solution.</li>
                <li>Bite your tougue. When you're attacked in a negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a calibrated question.</li>
                <li>There is always a team on the other side. If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable.</li>
