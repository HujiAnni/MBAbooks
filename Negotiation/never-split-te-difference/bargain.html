            <h2>How to Get Your Price:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify your counterpart's negotiating style. Once you know whether they are Accommodator, Assertive, or Analyst, you'll know the correct way to approach them.</li> <a href="http://info.blackswanltd.com/3-types">Check the Three Types PDF here</a>
                <li>Prepare, prepare, prepare. When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion; you fall to your highest level of preparation. So design an ambitious but legitimate goal and then game out the labels, calibrated questions, and responses you'll use to get there. That way, once you're at the bargaining table, you won't have to wing it.</li>
                <li>Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock you off your game. If you're not ready, you'll flee to your maximum without a flight. So prepare your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise trap.</li>
                <li>Set boundaries, and learn to take a punch or punch back, without anger. The guy across the table is not the problem, the situation is.</li>
                <li>Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, you'll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending on non-round numbers will get your counterpart to believe that he's squeezing you for all you're worth when you're really getting to the number <em>you</em> want.</li>
