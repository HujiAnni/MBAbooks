            <h2>Here are some key lessons from this chapter summarized by ChatGPT:</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>Focusing too much on getting the other party to say "yes" can lead to poor negotiation outcomes: By focusing too much on getting the other party to agree, you may end up making concessions that are not in your best interests.</li>
              <li>Use the word "no" effectively: Saying "no" can be a powerful negotiating tool, as it can establish boundaries and help you maintain your leverage. However, it's important to use "no" in a way that is respectful and constructive, rather than confrontational.</li>
              <li>Use "no" to create a sense of urgency: By using "no" to convey a sense of urgency or to set a deadline, you can help move the negotiation forward and increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.</li>
              <li>Be prepared to walk away: While it's important to be flexible and open to compromise, it's also important to be prepared to walk away from the negotiation if necessary and not agree to terms that are not in your best interests.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How to Generate Momentum and Make It Safe To Reveal the Real Stakes:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Break the habit of attempting to get people to say "yes". Being pushed for "yes" makes people defensive. Our love of hearing "yes" makes us blind to the defensivenes we ourselves feel whe someone is pushing us to say it.</li>
                <li>"No" is not a failure. We have learned that "No" is the anti-"Yes" and therefore a word to be avoided at all costs. But it really often just means "Wait" or "I'm not comfortable with that". Learn how to hear it calmly. It is not the end of the negotiation, but the beginning.</li>
                <li>"Yes" is the final goal of a negotiation, but don't aim for it at the start. Asking someone for "Yes" too quickly in a conversation - "Do you like to drink water?" - gets the counterpart's guard up and paints you as an untrustworthy salesman.</li>
                <li>Saying "No" makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they don't want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you. That's why "Is now a bad time to talk?" is always better than "Do you have a few minutes to talk?"</li>
                <li>Sometimes the only way to get your counterpart to listen and engage with you is by forcing them into a "No". Taht means intentionally mislabeling one of their emotions or desires or asking a ridiculous question - like, "It seems like you want this project to fail" - that can only be answered negatively.</li>
                <li>Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It's aboult the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don't beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It's not <em>about you</em>.</li>
                <li>If a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise "No"-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. "Have you given up on this project?" works wonders.</li>
