        <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It is a book written by former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss. The book offers practical negotiation techniques and strategies based on Voss's experiences negotiating with terrorists and criminals. Here are some key lessons from the book:</p>

      <ol class="col-md-8 fs-5">
        <li>Empathy is key: Understanding the other person's perspective and needs is crucial to successful negotiation.</li>
        <li>Use open-ended questions: Asking open-ended questions allows you to gather more information and helps you better understand the other person's perspective.</li>
        <li>Label emotions: Identifying and acknowledging the other person's emotions can help diffuse tension and create a more productive negotiation.</li>
        <li>Use mirroring: Repeating back the other person's words or phrases can help build rapport and create a sense of understanding.</li>
        <li>Make small concessions: Making small concessions can create a sense of momentum and build trust in the negotiation process.</li>
        <li>Use the "black swan" technique: Offering a "black swan" option, or an unexpected alternative that meets the other person's needs, can help break deadlocks and create new possibilities in the negotiation.</li>
        <li>Avoid the "yes" trap: Focusing too much on getting the other person to say "yes" can lead to poor negotiation outcomes. Instead, aim for mutual understanding and finding a solution that meets both parties' needs.</li>
